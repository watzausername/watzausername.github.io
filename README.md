# Seventyfive
Take on the 75-Day Challenge and transform your habits, discipline, and mindset — all with friends by your side. Endure is your daily habit tracker, streak keeper, and accountability partner for real change.

The 75-Day Challenge is a mental toughness program designed to help you build discipline, consistency, and resilience. Over 75 consecutive days, you commit to completing daily tasks without skipping a day. Typical daily goals include:

• Exercise twice a day (at least one outdoors)

• Follow a structured nutrition plan

• Drink plenty of water

• Read personal development content

• Take a progress photo

The challenge is designed to push you mentally and physically. Miss a task, and the day doesn’t count, so staying consistent is key. Endure makes it easier by helping you track all tasks, monitor streaks, and stay accountable, especially when you do it with friends.
