## 4. Third-Party Services

Our Apps may use third-party services that collect information to provide functionality such as:
- Analytics (e.g., app usage and performance)
- Crash reporting
- Cloud storage or syncing

These third parties have their own privacy policies, and we encourage you to review them.
                                                                  
                                                                                
  We use PostHog, a privacy-focused analytics service, to collect anonymous     
  usage data that helps us improve the app. This includes which screens you     
  visit, how often you use the app, and general usage patterns. We do not       
  collect any personally identifiable information, and all data is aggregated   
  and anonymized. No account creation is required, and we do not track your     
  location, contacts, or any other sensitive information. This data is used     
  solely to understand how users interact with the app so we can make it better.

Depending on your location, you may have the right to:
- Access the data we have about you
